Prerequisites: 
1. You will need Maven and Idea IDE installed on your computer. Get these here https://maven.apache.org/, https://www.jetbrains.com/
2. Clone AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder from GitRepo under the root folder of your choice say “AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder”

Skill artifacts:
1. Lambda Name : AlcoholAddictionHelper : https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/AlcoholAddictionHelper
2. S3 Bucket : quitdrinkingskillresource  : https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/quitdrinkingskillresource/?region=us-east-1
3. DynamoDB : AddictionHelperUserData : https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#tables:selected=AddictionHelperUserData

Q-1. How to change the text of the questions or the text message that Alexa asks?
1. All questions and the content of the Text Messages are captured in the skill.properties file under AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder/src/main/resources
2. Edit the skill.properties in the IDE of your choice (For example, Idea) and edit the content of Text message and/or question
3. Go to the Bash Prompt on your computer’s terminal and from the root folder of “AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder” build the project using the following command - “mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies package”
4. Upload the Addiction-Help-Finder-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar to the S3 bucket. The jar is created under AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder/target once the project is built successfully
5. Go to the Lambda, chose the option “Upload file from s3” under Code Entry Type. Provide the S3 URL, save and publish the Lambda
6. Test the skill

Q-2. How to query the user’s data for people who used the Skill?
1. All user data is saved at AddictionHelperUserData table
2. Go to the DDB table, where all data is saved. DDB allows querying of data as well as exporting the data in CSV format

Q-3. How to change the speech that Alexa expects to hear from the user?
1. All speechAssets are captured in skillBuilder.json under AlcoholAddictionHelpFinder/speechAssets. These are also published on the Alexa skill
2. Go to the Alexa Skill, under the Alexa Console. Select and edit the in Development skill for the “Quit Drinking App”
3. Traverse to Intents and select the intent where we need to make changes. For example “Add User” Intent. 
4. Create the new invocation under the intent and save and build the model. Note some invocation changes may need backend code changes as well.
5. Once the model is successfully built, copy the JSON from the JSON Editor, located towards the end of the Intents. Just above the Interfaces.
6. Paste the JSON to skillBuilder.json
7. Rebuild the project and deploy back to Lambda as per the instructions above in Q.1
8. Test the skill
